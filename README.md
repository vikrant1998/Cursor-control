This is the final project which I created for Harvard CS50x. It uses an Arduino Leonardo, an accelerometer and a light dependent resistor to control the computer cursor. I programmed it to measure the tilts and LDR touches of the user to control the cursor accordingly. The source code in C is attached above.
